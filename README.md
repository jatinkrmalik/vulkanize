## üì• Installation

### Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vulkanize/releases) page
2. Extract the archive to a location of your choice
3. Follow the platform-specific instructions below

### Windows

1. Connect your device via USB cable
2. Enable USB debugging on your device
3. Run `vulkan-enabler.bat` by double-clicking on it
4. If ADB is not found, the script will attempt to install it automatically using Windows Package Manager (winget)
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

### macOS

1. Connect your device via USB cable
2. Enable USB debugging on your device
3. Open Terminal and navigate to the extracted folder
4. Make the script executable: `chmod +x scripts/mac/vulkan-enabler.sh`
5. Run the script: `./scripts/mac/vulkan-enabler.sh`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions

### Linux

1. Connect your device via USB cable
2. Enable USB debugging on your device
3. Open Terminal and navigate to the extracted folder
4. Make the script executable: `chmod +x scripts/linux/vulkan-enabler.sh`
5. Run the script: `./scripts/linux/vulkan-enabler.sh`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions

For more detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## üì± Usage

### Interactive Mode

All scripts provide an interactive menu with the following options:

1. **Check device connection**: Verify your device is properly connected and recognized
2. **Enable Vulkan (Normal mode)**: Apply Vulkan with minimal app restarts
3. **Enable Vulkan (Aggressive mode)**: Apply Vulkan with more thorough app restarts
4. **Verify Vulkan status**: Instructions to confirm Vulkan is enabled
5. **Help and information**: Details about the tool and its effects
6. **Exit**: Close the application

### Command Line Mode

All scripts support command-line parameters for automation:

```
# Windows
vulkan-enabler.bat --simple --normal

# macOS/Linux
./vulkan-enabler.sh --simple --aggressive
```

Available options:
- `--simple`: Run in simple mode with fewer prompts
- `--log`: Enable detailed logging
- `--normal`: Enable Vulkan in normal mode and exit
- `--aggressive`: Enable Vulkan in aggressive mode and exit
- `--help`: Show help information

## üîç Verification

To verify that Vulkan is enabled:

1. On your phone, go to Settings
2. Open Developer Options (tap Build Number 7 times if not enabled)
3. Enable GPUWatch
4. Open any app (like the dialer)
5. Look for "Vulkan Renderer (skiavk)" in the overlay

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- The Vulkan setting reverts after device reboot - run the script again to re-enable
- Some apps may display visual artifacts when using Vulkan
- Some apps may not run correctly under Vulkan
- Default browser and keyboard settings may reset
- Possible loss of WiFi-Calling/VoLTE (fix by toggling SIM in settings)

For troubleshooting and solutions, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## üìö Technical Details

Vulkanize works by setting the `debug.hwui.renderer` property to `skiavk`, which forces the system to use Vulkan instead of OpenGL ES for rendering. The script then forces key system components to restart to apply the new setting.

For more technical information, see [TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md).

## üìà Performance Improvements

Users have reported the following improvements after enabling Vulkan:

- Up to 30% better performance in demanding applications
- 5-10¬∞C cooler operation under load
- 15-20% better battery life

*Note: Your results may vary depending on your specific device, apps, and usage patterns.*
